## About

**Introducing GneissWeb (pronounced "niceWeb"), a state-of-the-art LLM pre-training dataset**

This introductory session will not be a Hands-on workshop, but I will take the audience through code examples that they can try at their leisure. Later on, in the meetups, I can make this a hands-on workshop.
Description: At IBM, responsible AI implies transparency in training data:
Introducing GneissWeb (pronounced “niceWeb”), a state-of-the-art LLM pre-training dataset with ~10 Trillion tokens derived from FineWeb, with open recipes, results, and tools for reproduction!

👉 > 2% avg improvement in benchmark performance over FineWeb
